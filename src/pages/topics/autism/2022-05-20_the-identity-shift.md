For the longest time these have been phrases that are very hard for me to respond to. These questions have felt _off_ to
me, like there would be something that I simply can't figure out. Others seemed to have less or no difficulty with those
questions. It was like I was alone with this: with difficulties in defining myself in a way that would **feel correct**.

So I've tried all sorts of ways to introduce myself on the web. At times I tried to follow some guides. No help. As
years have passed **none have felt right**. I've ended up removing my old homepages and their content as they just
weren't "me".

And here I am, starting fresh with content yet again on one of my homepages. However this time is a little different.
I've become aware of neurodiversity. And now I am sure that I am autistic. <span aria-hidden="true">ðŸŽ‰</span>

## Life outside diagnosis

The traditional view to autism has been **very narrow minded** and **awfully negative**. When I read the old indicators
I never find myself from them. Who would like to be like that? Are autistic people really that awful?

Turns out: no. They are not. The old descriptions were made by neurotypical people. People who can't grasp the nature of
the autistic experience, and this is why the descriptions were never a fit! A lot of the focus was put on troublesome
boys who had lots of difficulties and who didn't get their needs met, leading to breakdowns, depression, all sorts of
issues. But many of those issues were not due to autism. They were due to the environment and expectations. Forcing
people to be in situations that weren't good for them. The same problems happen to neurotypical people too if they are
forced into unfit conditions.

These days we are much better aware of neurodivergent people. Unlike in the past we now have lots of adults and also
women noticing that they are autistic. And they often figure this out by reading **experiences by others**. This is also
how I started to really consider that I might be one: I read a few articles where real life experiences were told by
autistic persons. Oddly enough the female descriptions often matched my experiences better than those of males. And just
in case it is unclear, I am male.

> So the autistic TL;DR is:
>
> Individuals who think and experience life very differently compared to majority of people.

But I'm not looking to get an official diagnosis. Why? Well, there isn't much I would gain from it. I've been able to
live my life without major issues. I have been able to get myself into work life. I have had mental health issues and my
life could certainly be better than it has been or is right now. And still, I haven't had so bad a trouble that I would
have required to get an official diagnosis.

This is also the current recommendation: don't get diagnosis if you are not looking to get support and benefits that you
would require to survive in life.

## Is it better? Is it worse?

One of the great things being autistic is the ability to connect patterns much more easily than most folks. Given enough
time and knowledge you become a person who is kind of aware about things before they happen. This does have it's painful
side, too: often an autistic person can be so much ahead the curve with their ideas that others are not ready understand
what it is that the autistic person is trying to say. In this sense autistic people can be innovators: see the most
likely future before it happens. But they tend to be alone with this for years until enough many people catch up with
the idea so that even the neurotypicals are able to find their language for the subject and "gain permission" for it.

Another gift is the increased sensitivity: feeling, hearing, seeing, it is all in extreme high definition. I can notice
things around that others omit. But there is a downside to this: it is mentally taxing to get all this input all the
time. And for this reason places that are noisy, flashy, busy, full of everything everywhere all at once are a pain.
Cities are not built for autistic people. Malls full of people are not for autistic people. Echoing spaces with reduced
nature are not for autistic people. It is simply too much and we are immediately exhausted in such spaces. Because all
of it that happens hits us so hard.

In the end being autistic isn't really better nor worse. It is only being different. And even the autistic traits are
very much varying from person to person: I have some characteristics others do not. Others have stuff that don't apply
to my experience. There is a natural divergence like with everything else. There is no pure boolean true/false condition
for being autistic. The same as it is with sex. There are people who are neither male nor female, or are kinda both. And
this holds true despite many people claiming there are only men and women.

## The difficulties

One of the greatest downsides in autism is that it is so easy to be alone. This is certainly something that I suffer
from, even despite being married. Unlike some lucky ones I haven't found other neurodivergent people to have in my daily
life. And I have never learnt a good way to connect with others. No, not even via family: when I was a child we lived
very far off from our relatives, and this has never changed in my life. I've continued living in southern Finland where
I've been able to get employed. In the north it is unlikely for me to find a job.

But hey, there is the Internet! And yes, I can find other autistic people that way. But I still haven't found a friend
who'd be a part of my daily life. Admittedly I do have a very high threshold to actually send a message to anyone. Oddly
enough despite this lonesomeness I did manage to build a community on the web that has been around for over 20 years.
And still, even with that and people there, I don't often feel like I'd be part of the same group. Maybe I can work this
issue over the years: it hasn't been even a year now that I've started to mentally shift my own identity to that of an
autistic person.

> I still find it difficult to call myself an autist.

There are also "less heavy" difficulties to being autistic. Like meetings at work. Those events are troublesome because
I either have to be in them with 100% focus, or with limited focus. And still in both cases I often become exhausted.
Ideal meeting to me would be short and to-the-point which is the opposite to neurotypical people, who often want to make
it a session of conventions where everything has to be gone through with a lot of words. A ritual ceremony where they
want to reach a concensus.

This works for neurotypicals because they often don't catch everything. But for neurodivergent people it is an
information bomb event. To me meetings are often either "record everything to my mind", or "listen passively while doing
something else and filter for interesting stuff". Both cases require the brain to do extra work.

## Tell me something about yourself

So who I am? I'm an autistic person who works as a programmer and loves computers. I like doing stuff in a way that
cares about other people so nobody wastes their time with a broken or poor experience.

How I am? I'm probably not aware of my current feelings in a way that I can tell you how they are. I can come back to
you in maybe 30 minutes after actively thinking about the subject. But I rather just say "I'm okay" to avoid the need to
spend so much time on it!

Are we done? I guess we are done. Have a nice day!
