The palette images here include the color gradients for each color which were used to provide texture shading, thus
contributing to the unique look of the game. The game has three different environments, or texture sets, and thus has
three different palettes.

## Greenland palette

Gold Edition / Mission CD palette (version 1.51):

Original release of the game (v1.0) had bugs in the color gradients: palette had been updated with new colors, but gradient table had not been updated.

Beta release (v0.16) had a slightly different palette:

This is a very low hanging fruit look into the game. I also maintain [The Settlers II.net](https://settlers2.net) where
you can find much more about this game!
